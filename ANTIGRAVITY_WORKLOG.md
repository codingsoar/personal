# Antigravity Work Log

## Logging Rule
- Goal: Keep a portable, append-only record so work can continue in Antigravity.
- Format: Add one entry per request using the fixed template below.
- Update policy: Append a new entry at the end for every new task.
- Required sections: `Request`, `Scope`, `Implemented`, `Validation`, `Files`, `Notes`.

## Entry Template

Copy this block for every new entry:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD - Short Task Title

### Request
- What the user asked for.

### Scope
- What area of the codebase was touched.
- What was intentionally out of scope.

### Implemented
- Concrete change 1
- Concrete change 2

### Validation
- `command` -> Success/Failed
- Manual check -> result

### Files
- `path/to/file`
- `path/to/file`

### Notes
- Follow-up risks, assumptions, or handoff details.
```

## Writing Rules
- Keep each section short and factual.
- Prefer exact file paths, commands, and behaviors over narrative summary.
- If validation was blocked, say why explicitly.
- If the task overlaps with concurrent edits, mention that in `Notes`.
- Do not rewrite older entries unless the user explicitly asks.

- No feature implementation was performed.

### Implemented
- Recorded initial workspace snapshot for future handoff.
- Established append-only worklog usage for future Antigravity continuity.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` -> Failed (8 issues)
- `npm run build` (sandbox) -> Failed (`spawn EPERM`)
- `npm run build` (escalated) -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `src/index.css`
- `tuto.html`

### Notes
- Workspace snapshot at the time of analysis:
  - Modified: `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
  - Modified: `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`

## 2026-02-19 - Plan Review Request (Tutorial HTML Upload)

### Request
- User requested review/approval of updated `implementation_plan.md` and `task.md` for tutorial HTML upload flow.

### Scope
- Review of requested plan documents and related tutorial upload references.
- No code changes were made.

### Implemented
- Searched for `implementation_plan.md`, `task.md`, `MissionEditorModal`, `htmlContent`, and `tutorial`.
- Confirmed the referenced documents/content were not present in the workspace.
- Provided preliminary architecture guidance based on the described direction.

### Validation
- Manual search -> No matching files or relevant content found in workspace

### Files
- `implementation_plan.md`
- `task.md`

### Notes
- Formal document review was blocked due to missing files.
- Preliminary direction was acceptable: admin upload -> mission `htmlContent` -> student iframe render.
- Requirements called out for implementation:
  - sanitize uploaded HTML before save/render
  - restrict iframe sandbox
  - enforce HTML payload size limit
  - define explicit completion trigger for tutorial missions

---

## 2026-02-19 - Implementation (Antigravity Continuation)

### Request
- Continue implementation from Antigravity context.
- Add tutorial HTML upload in admin flow and render it for students in mission view.

### Scope
- Admin mission editor tutorial upload flow.
- Student mission rendering for tutorial HTML content.

### Implemented
- Extended `MissionEditorModal` in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` with `htmlContent` and `htmlFileName`.
- Added tutorial HTML upload input for `type === 'tutorial'`.
- Implemented file read via `file.text()` and mission payload binding.
- Added 1 MB size guard with `MAX_TUTORIAL_HTML_BYTES`.
- Added upload error feedback and loaded file summary text.
- Updated `TutorialView` in `src/pages/MissionPage.jsx` to render `mission.htmlContent` with `iframe srcDoc`.
- Added `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups"` for tutorial HTML iframe rendering.
- Added completion checkbox and complete button for HTML tutorial mode.
- Kept existing `tutorialSteps` flow as fallback.
- Updated main mission render routing to use `mission.type` first with difficulty fallback.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx src/pages/MissionPage.jsx` -> Partial success
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/MissionPage.jsx`

### Notes
- Feature path is now connected end-to-end for tutorial HTML missions.
- `src/pages/MissionPage.jsx` had no new lint errors from this change.
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` still had pre-existing issues:
  - `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
  - `no-unused-vars` (`submissions`)
  - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning
- Existing repo-wide lint debt remained unresolved and unrelated to this feature.

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Session Calendar

### Request
- Show lesson sessions on the admin dashboard calendar for the dates they were created.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar rendering only.
- Assessment session storage behavior remained unchanged.

### Implemented
- Wired `useAssessmentStore(state => state.sessionScores)` into the admin dashboard flow in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Built date-keyed calendar data from `sessionScores`.
- Deduplicated session entries by `courseId + sessionDate + sessionLabel` because sessions are stored per assessment area.
- Passed aggregated session data into `DashboardCalendar`.
- Replaced mock calendar data with prop-based input in `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`.
- Rendered per-date session count and up to two session labels in each day cell.
- Added selected-date detail panel listing all sessions for that date with course title.
- Cleared selected state if the underlying date data disappears.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM` during Vite config resolution, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- This task overlapped with other concurrent changes already present in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- This change affects admin dashboard visibility only; assessment session storage behavior was not changed.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Session Calendar Layout Cleanup

### Request
- Show the course name for each session on the admin dashboard calendar.
- Keep session items inside each date cell without overflowing.
- Improve alignment and allow the calendar to be larger if needed.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar UI only.
- No changes to session aggregation or assessment storage behavior.

### Implemented
- Reworked `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` date-cell layout to use taller fixed-height cells.
- Added compact session preview cards with `courseTitle` on the first line and session label on the second line.
- Added per-day count badge in the cell header.
- Limited in-cell preview to two items plus an overflow summary.
- Kept selected-date detail panel and reordered its content to show course first, then session label.
- Updated calendar heading copy to match the new session-focused behavior.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten as a whole to avoid patch drift from mixed text encoding in the previous file content.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Width Expansion

### Request
- Move the course progress panel below the calendar.
- Make the calendar wider horizontally so text in date cells is less likely to be clipped.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard overview layout only.
- No changes to calendar data generation.

### Implemented
- Removed the side-by-side calendar/progress layout in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Placed `DashboardCalendar` in its own full-width block.
- Moved the course progress card below the calendar.
- Expanded the dashboard overview container from `max-w-7xl` to full width.
- Changed the course progress card body to a responsive grid so it still uses space efficiently after moving below the calendar.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`

### Notes
- This was a layout-only change to create more horizontal room for date-cell content.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Layout Structure Fix

### Request
- Re-check the dashboard because the course progress panel had not actually moved below the calendar.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard overview JSX structure only.
- No visual redesign beyond correcting the broken layout nesting.

### Implemented
- Restored the missing closing wrapper for the top statistics grid in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Removed the extra closing wrapper after the course progress section.
- Kept the intended layout: full-width calendar first, course progress card below it.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`

### Notes
- The previous change had left the stats grid wrapper unclosed, which caused the layout to render differently from the intended structure.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Cell Scrolling

### Request
- Allow scrolling inside a date cell when many sessions are assigned to the same date.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar cell rendering only.
- No changes to dashboard layout or session aggregation.

### Implemented
- Reworked `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` so each date cell keeps a fixed height while the session list area scrolls vertically.
- Increased the day-cell height slightly to create more room for the in-cell list.
- Changed the cell content from preview-plus-summary to a full in-cell scrollable list of sessions.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten again to avoid patch instability caused by mixed text encoding in the previous version.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Course Icons

### Request
- Replace in-cell course text with course icons so date cells can show session labels more compactly.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar session display only.
- No changes to session storage or dashboard layout.

### Implemented
- Added `courseIcon` into the aggregated session calendar data in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Used the course icon from course metadata, with `📚` as fallback.
- Updated `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` so date cells show `icon + session label` instead of course name text.
- Kept the selected-date detail panel showing both course icon and course title for clarity.
- Replaced the in-cell scroll list with a compact preview of up to four sessions plus an overflow count.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten to normalize prior mixed text content and make the compact icon-based layout deterministic.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Pill Layout

### Request
- Show sessions inside date cells as compact button-like items sized to their text, instead of full-row blocks.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar cell UI only.
- No changes to aggregated session data structure.

### Implemented
- Reworked `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` session preview items into compact rounded pills.
- Changed the in-cell session container to a wrapping layout so pills flow naturally across the available width.
- Increased the visible item cap in the cell to six pills before showing an overflow counter.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten again to keep the compact pill layout deterministic and avoid patch drift.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Session Ordering

### Request
- Sort sessions in the calendar in natural lesson order.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard session aggregation sort order only.
- No UI structure changes.

### Implemented
- Updated `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` calendar session sort comparator to use Korean natural string ordering with numeric comparison.
- Added course-title fallback ordering when labels are identical.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`

### Notes
- This makes labels like `1차시, 2차시, 10차시` render in expected numeric order instead of pure lexical order.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Badge/Achievement System

### Request
- Implement a comprehensive badge/achievement system (100 badges) for students.

### Scope
- Created badge definitions and conditions.
- Implemented global badge checking store and notification UI.
- Integrated badge collection UI into `StudentProfilePage` and `AdminPage`.
- Fixed CSS `@import` build error.

### Implemented
- Added `src/data/badgesData.js` with 100 badge definitions and `condition(stats)` functions.
- Added `src/stores/useBadgeStore.js` to manage unlocked badges, calculate aggregated `stats`, and trigger checks.
- Added `src/components/BadgeNotification.jsx` to show animated toast popups upon unlocking via `badgeUnlocked` CustomEvent.
- Added `<BadgeNotification />` to global routing layout in `src/App.jsx`.
- Added "My Badges" section in `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`.
- Added "View Badges" modal in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` (Learners Management) for admins to inspect student achievements.
- Moved `@import url(...)` before `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/index.css` to fix Vite build error.

### Validation
- Vite dev server -> Success, application loads without white screen.
- UI -> Admin badge modal and student profile badge grids render correctly.

### Files
- `src/data/badgesData.js`
- `src/stores/useBadgeStore.js`
- `src/components/BadgeNotification.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/index.css`

### Notes
- Badge unlocking relies on evaluating `progress`, `sessions`, `purchases` globally from `useBadgeStore.getState().checkBadges()`, triggered by `BadgeNotification`'s `useEffect` listener to other stores.
- Built compatibly with Codex's concurrent modifications to `AdminPage.jsx` (Session Calendar).

---

## 2026-03-12 - Push Current Workspace Changes

### Request
- Push the current workspace changes to the remote repository.

### Scope
- Repository state management and remote sync only.
- No new product behavior changes beyond recording the push task in the worklog.

### Implemented
- Reviewed `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md` and current `git status` before sync.
- Prepared the current workspace changes for commit and push.

### Validation
- `git status --short --branch` -> Success
- `git push` -> Pending

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Commit and push details will match the final synced workspace state for this task.
